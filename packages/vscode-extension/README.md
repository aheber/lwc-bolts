# Lightning Bolts

### bolting your LWC components together better

This extension surfaces Apex, Custom Object, Custom Labels, and many more metadata types as importable modules for your LWC components with improved compatibility and context. Enhancing support for things like type-ahead auto-complete and making Go To Definition land in the correct files we makes it easier than ever to build well-integrated components with Salesforce and quickly inspect where those imported pieces are defined.

We also bolt your individual components together more deeply. If one LWC references another then VS Code will have auto completion for exported content and enabled intellisense for those imported pieces.

This extension is only aware of components you have on your computer. We do not inspect your org for additional metadata. Let us know if it is important to you for us to add that capability.
